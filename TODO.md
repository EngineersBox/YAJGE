* Create custom exceptions
* Throw exceptions to be caught in engine try-catch rather than progressing (when applicable)
* Create tangent space transform to ensure object space or adapt shader view matrix to account for it
* Created enum declarations for uniform names and update magic string references
* Create deferred shading pipeline
* Physics system
* PBR and IBL
* Scalable LOD
* Implement shadows for point lights and spotlights
* Dynamic light instance counts (non-fixed limit of 5)
* Fix particle texture not masked by shadow or fog
* Implement animation lerp for linear, non-linear and custom curves
* Auto create bounding box for meshes based on best fit to cube, sphere, etc
* Enable early fragment testing to increase performance with shaders
